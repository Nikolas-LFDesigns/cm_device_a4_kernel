to compile kernel:

place arm-eabi-4.4.3 toolchain to home folder so you will have a path like that:
~/arm-eabi-4.4.3/bin/arm-eabi-

my config named as acer - acer_a4_defconfig and located at /kernel/arch/arm/configs/acer_a4_defconfig
you should place it as .config in root of kernel folder to make kernel compile for a4.

in terminal:
cd kernel
export ARCH=arm
export CROSS_COMPILE=~/arm-eabi-4.4.3/bin/arm-eabi-
make menuconfig
make -j[num of cpu cores*2]
